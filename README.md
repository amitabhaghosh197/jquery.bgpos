The original jquery.bgpos by Alexander Farkas is hosted at http://code.google.com/p/exteenscript/downloads/detail?name=jquery.bgpos.js&can=2

It is not maintained as far as I can tell and is currently incompatible with jQuery 1.8.x.  You can read my original blog post here: nelsonwells.net/2012/08/using-bgpos-js-with-jquery-18
